# Webscraping-Malaysian-Petrol-Prices
An simple exercise where www.petrolpricemalaysia.com is scraped for petrol and diesel price information.

Results are returned in a list form for now. Not sure what direction to take at this juncture.

Update 2021-01-03:
I find that https://petrolpricemalaysia.info/ updates are more regular. Therefore I have decided on discarding the petrol_prices.ipynb script and continuing with the PetrolPriceMsia.ipynb from now on.

Future development:
1. automate the process, perhaps via cron job
2. upload results and append to Google Sheets file
